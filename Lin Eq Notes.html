    <p>Constants, as the word might suggest, refers to a <b style="color:Highlight">Constant value</b>. What this means is that it has a <b style="color:Highlight">Specific value</b> and cannot change. So, numbers like 2, -1, 3, 10, are all <b style="color:Highlight">Constants</b>
    <br /> On the other hand, Algebra also deals with terms called <b style="color:Highlight">Variables</b>. This refers to its ability to vary. They are usually denoted with <b style ="color:Highlight">Alphabets (x,y,n)  OR  Symbols(#,$,^).</b> If they vary, it means that its value can change in different scenarios.
    For Example-
    <br />If a number, say <b style="color:Highlight">X</b>, is added to 7 to make it 8, What would it be? One, Of course. But if instead of this, it was -
    <br />If a number, say <b style="color:Highlight">X</b>, is added to 7 to make it 9, What would it be? Two, in this case. So, it has the ability to vary, unlike constants.</p>
    <p> In an <b style="color: darkorange">Algebraic Expression</b>, a combination of Variables and Constants is operated upon with different operations like-
    <br /> <b style="color:Highlight"> Addition {+}
        <br />Subtraction {-}
        <br />Multiplication {×}
        <br />Division {÷}</b>
