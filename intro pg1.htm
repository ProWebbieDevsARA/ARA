                    Hi folks, Welcome to ALL Round Academy!. What we are going to do in this lesson is explore the world of numbers from 1 to 20. Like you have names to be unique, why not numbers?. Yes! Numbers also have names.
                    That is what we will be studying in this chapter.</p>
                    
                    <br /><p>We all have names right? Why? So that we are all different from each-other. Just like that, numbers also need to be distinguished them from others. In this chapter, we will learn only numbers and their names
                    from 1 - 20. But as you advance, you will learn till 100! So , let's start :-
                               <br />--> 1 , ONE <audio controls>
                <source src="Audio for G1/1 one.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
                  <source src="Audio for G1/1 one.mp3" type="audio/wav" />
                    <source src="Audio for G1/1 one.mp3" type="audio/ogg"/>
                </audio>
                         <br />--> 2 , TWO 
                    <br />--> 3 , THREE
                    <br />--> 4 , FOUR
                    <br />--> 5 , FIVE
                    <br />--> 6 , SIX
                    <br />--> 7 , SEVEN
                    <br />--> 8 , EIGHT
                    <br />--> 9 , NINE
                    <br />--> 10 , TEN
                    <br />--> 11 , ELEVEN
                    <br />--> 12 , TWELVE
                    <br />--> 13 , THIRTEEN
                    <br />--> 14 , FOURTEEN
                    <br />--> 15 , FIFTEEN
                    <br />--> 16 , SIXTEEN
                    <br />--> 17 , SEVENTEEN
                    <br />--> 18 , EIGHTEEN
                    <br />--> 19 , NINETEEN
                    <br />--> 20 , TWENTY
                    <br />
                    <br /> I know it might seem too much to retain at once but, try hard and whenever you are tired, take a break then come back again!
                    Try to retain as much as you can as the next lesson (21- 100) is based on it. Good luck!
